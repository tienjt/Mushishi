    <li>Ah are snail-shaped mushi that infect the ears of humans, causing all sound to be blocked.</li>
	<li>They co-exist with the mushi Un and feast on the silence that the Un create.</li>
	<li>Victims of the Ah and Un will grow horns on their head that capture the echo of every mushi sound on Earth, which is like a constant tidal wave of sound.</li></ul>

    <li>Ganpuku are rare mushi that enter the body of any living creature that looks at it directly and take control of the eyes.</li>
	<li>Over time, the host develops the ability to see unnatural distances, through objects, and eventually the past and future of anyone she looks at.</li>
	<li>When a Ganpuku finally completes its takeover of the host's eyes, the eyes fall out and the mushi breaks free.</li></ul>

	<li>If the larval form is burned, the adult form will manifest and feast on the body heat of living organisms.</li>
	<li>Anyone eating food cooked by Kagebi will slowly freeze, as will the person unlucky enough to inhale it.</li></ul>
