<h1>Plot</h1><br />

  <p><i>Mushishi</i> is set in an imaginary time between the Edo and Meiji periods. The story features primitive, ubiquitous creatures called mushi that often display what seem to be supernatural powers. Due to their ethereal nature most humans are incapable of perceiving mushi and are oblivious to their existence, but there are a few who possess the ability to see and interact with mushi. One such person is Ginko, the main character of the series. He employs himself as a mushi master (mushishi), traveling from place to place to research them and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.</p><br />

  <p>The series is an episodic anthology in which the only common elements among episodes are Ginko and the various types of mushi. A majority of the stories do not focus on Ginko; rather they rely on him as a catalyst to move the story forward by diagnosing or curing mushi-related illnesses and phenomena.</p>
